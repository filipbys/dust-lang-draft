Dust is an accessible, human-focused, biologically-inspired programming language.

## The Problem with Traditional Programming Languages

In a nutshell, plain text files and folders are a poor mechanism for organizing large projects.

| Everything is at the same font size, whether it's your project's high-level structure or the smallest most insignificant detail. Joining a long-standing project is like being thrown into an ocean of text with nothing but ad-hoc, poorly-maintained documentation as a floatation device. | Dust merges text-based mathematical notation at the smallest level with biologically-inspired organizational structures at higher levels. A Dust project is organized on an infinite canvas that behaves much like a map (think for example Google Maps): you zoom out to see the high-level structure and organization of the program, and zoom in to edit a particular piece of it. Less important details vanish as you zoom out, while more important ones get bigger in order to stay visible.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Grouping: nested expressions, even ones that are only a few parentheses deep, can be extremely hard for humans to read in plain text.                                                                                                                                                        | In Dust, grouping is done with circles and rectangles that grow/shrink as needed: outer groups are always bigger than inner groups, adding a rich layer of visual detail to make expressions easier to read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Accessibility: built-in screen readers struggle to read code in a useful way, requiring external language-specific tooling (citation needed).                                                                                                                                                | Dust is built from the ground up using [W3 Web Accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/). The meaning and purpose of every element or group is explicit in the HTML, so screen readers have direct access to it. For instance, rather than reading an expression like "[a, b, (f c)]" as "Open square bracket a comma b comma open parenthese f c close parenthese close square bracket", it would say something like "Begin array, identifier a, identifier b, Begin function call, function-identifier f parameter-identifier c, end function call, end array". TBD: perhaps one day an AI voice assistant could also help answer complicated natural-language questions. |
| In general, text-based languages need powerful IDE support in order for their developers to be productive. IDEs are often slow and resource-intensive.                                                                                                                                       | Dust is a lightning-fast cross-platform web-app with many IDE features built into it from the ground up (TBD: the editor/IDE part could be split into its own project to enable support for other languages via e.g. LSP)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Dust is "Readability-Oriented"

You can write Dust code in any paradigm: Functional, Imperative, Procedural, Object-Oriented, you name it.
Dust focuses on how easy your project's structure is to read and understand.
